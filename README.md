👋 Hi, I'm @Shraddhasingh3!

    👀 I'm passionate about diving into the exciting world of Machine Learning, Python, C, OpenCV, and ROS2.

    🌱 I'm currently learning and exploring advanced concepts in machine learning, honing my skills in Python programming, and delving into Computer Vision with OpenCV. Additionally, I'm navigating the intricacies of Robotics Operating System 2 (ROS2) to enhance my understanding of robotic applications.

    💞️ I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on projects related to machine learning, computer vision, robotics, or any intersection of these fields. If you have interesting ideas or projects, feel free to reach out!

    📫 You can connect with me through [your preferred contact method, e.g., email, LinkedIn, etc.]. I'm always open to discussions, collaborations, and sharing knowledge with fellow enthusiasts.

    😄 Pronouns: She/Her

    ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not immersed in coding and algorithms, you can find me exploring new hiking trails or experimenting with cooking exotic dishes!

Looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and creating some awesome projects together! 🚀✨
